# World Generation with Seed

The world generation process is designed to create reproducible maps using a seed value. The seed ensures that every time the world is generated with the same seed, the layout and properties of the map remain identical.

## How It Works

1. **Seed Initialization**:
   - When generating a world, a seed value is provided.
   - A deterministic pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is initialized with this seed.
   - The PRNG produces a predictable sequence of numbers, meaning that identical seeds yield identical sequences.

2. **Map Layout**:
   - The world consists of a grid defined by `WORLD_WIDTH` and `WORLD_HEIGHT`.
   - Each cell in the grid represents a tile.
   - Using the PRNG, the generation algorithm assigns a tile type (such as Tree, Grass, or Water) to each grid cell based on the generated numbers.
   - With the same seed, the same sequence of random choices is made, resulting in the same tile layout.

3. **Tile Placement**:
   - The algorithm iterates over each cell in the grid.
   - For each cell, the PRNG is called to produce a random number.
   - This number is then mapped to a specific tile type using predefined mapping rules.
   - As the mapping is deterministic, the same seed always produces the same arrangement of tile types.

4. **Reproducibility and Consistency**:
   - Using a seed ensures that the overall randomness is entirely predictable.
   - Developers and users can reproduce the exact same world simply by supplying the same seed.
   - This reproducibility is essential for debugging, sharing maps, and ensuring consistent gameplay experiences when desired.

## Benefits

- **Predictability**: The same seed leads to the same map configuration every time, making the process ideal for testing and debugging.
- **Shareability**: Users can share intriguing world maps by exchanging the seed value.
- **Replayability**: Players can revisit and experience the same world layout as originally generated, enhancing the gaming experience.

## Future Enhancements

The current world generation system is a foundation for more complex systems. Future versions may include additional parameters such as:
- Biomes and terrain variations.
- Elevation changes and climate effects.
- Dynamic events tied to specific world layouts.

Even with these enhancements, using a seed will continue to guarantee a reproducible and consistent world generation process.

## Conclusion

The seed-based world generation offers a robust foundation for creating vast, varied, yet reproducible worlds. By using a seed to drive the random number generation, the process ensures that every generated world is both unique and repeatable, providing a powerful tool for both developers and players.
